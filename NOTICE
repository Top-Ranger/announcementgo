AnnouncementGo! - A simple survey software

AnnouncementGo! is my personal software for sending announcements.
It was developed with simplicity in mind - both in deployment and architecture.
As such, it might contain certain restrictions in terms of extensibility.
I developed the software with my specific needs in mind. It contains everything I need.
It might not fit your needs. That's ok.
But don't expect me to go out of my way implementing your requests.
I'm releasing the software in the hope that it might be helpful to others.

To run it, simply use the following commands:
go get -u ./...
go build
./announcementgo

A sample configration can be found at "./config.json".
A sample configuration for announcement management can be found at "config/test.json"
