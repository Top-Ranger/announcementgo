AnnouncementGo! - A simple survey software
   created by Marcus Soll (https://msoll.eu)

AnnouncementGo! is my personal software for sending announcements.
It was developed with simplicity in mind - both in deployment and architecture.
As such, it might contain certain restrictions in terms of extensibility.
I developed the software with my specific needs in mind. It contains everything I need.
It might not fit your needs. That's ok.
But don't expect me to go out of my way implementing your requests.
I'm releasing the software in the hope that it might be helpful to others.

To run it, simply use the following commands:
go get -u ./...
go build
./announcementgo

A sample server configration can be found at "./config.json".
The configuration of the announcements is splitted in two parts: 
   - The server admin can set passwords and allow plugins. A sample configuration for announcement management can be found at "config/test.json".
   - The admin of an announcement page can configure the plugins through the website.
(The user can only send announcements, but can neither configure plugins nor see the configration)
